BrixSGCalc
==========

I thoroughly enjoy reinventing the wheel for my own sick pleasure.
In the same vein as PrimingRateCalc I have coded a simple script to calculate Brix from a refractometer
to a more useful (to brewer's) specific gravity. Using the math from http://www.brewersfriend.com/brix-converter/ which,
in turn is based on http://byo.com/stories/item/1314-refractometers-and-mash-outs-mr-wizard.

As with PrimingRateCalc this is mainly for my own personal entertainment and therefore has no error handling.
Please keep that in mind.
